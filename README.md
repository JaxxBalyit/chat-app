# Chat App

This is the project for a Chat App. I hope you love it ♥

## Description

This app is made in 2 parts, client and server.\
You can chat in real time with your friends or other people. All you need to do is add them to your conversation.\
There are many things that can be improved, but it can be a good idea to start a project if you want to do a chat app.

### Notes

1.- Password validation can be added for Login and Signup. In my case, I didn't do it because I only do it as a template. In case you want to add it, consult the StreamChat documentation and add the logic.\
[Stream Chat Documentation](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/).

2.- The **API Key** and **Secret API KEY** variables used in **.env** file are deleted after the upload, so they don't work for anything.
